# CGscale-PCB
PCB designs for CG scale based on @Olkal 's design.

Note that some files are labelled as `robotcontrol` but they are the same thing, I just accidently nmaed it after another project I was working on.

###The schematics have been exported as PDF but if you want to view the full project, You will need to open the .pro file with KiCad EDA .
